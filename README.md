# weather-dashboard

## Description

This code creates a dynamic weather dashboard that utilizes the open weather one call API (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api). 

It lets the user search for the city of their choosing. It then displays the current date, temperature, humidity, uv index, wind speed, and icon for weather for conditions. Below the current weather, it displays a fiv day forecast showing the same elements for the next five days in the same city.

When the user returns, their search cities will save below the search bar. The user can then click those stored cities and the weather conditions will display.

## Installation

This code can be used with access to html, css, Jquery and Javascript that can be run in a browser.

## Usage

This application can be used by anyone wanting realy time weather data. They can include other parameters in the dashboard outside of the ones currently displayed through the API. 

When a city is searched, that city will be able to be searched as a button without typing the name in the search bar. The forecast can also be expanded to seven days from five.
